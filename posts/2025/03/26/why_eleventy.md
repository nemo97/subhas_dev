When it comes to building modern websites, there are countless tools and frameworks to choose from. I initially started with the popular option, WordPress. It offers a vast array of plugins and themes, allowing for extensive customization. However, I encountered a significant challenge when attempting to implement a shopping cart feature. This required modifying PHP code, which consumed far more time than I had anticipated. As a result, I began exploring alternatives.

Being proficient in React, I decided to try [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). However, I quickly realized that Next.js is not an ideal fit for static websites without a backend. My goal was to create a static site to take advantage of Digital Ocean's free hosting. This led me to explore other static site generators, specifically [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). While both are excellent tools, I ultimately chose Eleventy for my personal projects. Here’s why:

### 1. **Simplicity and Minimalism**

Eleventy is a static site generator that prioritizes simplicity. It avoids unnecessary complexity and features that are not essential. This minimalistic approach aligns perfectly with my objective of creating fast, lightweight, and straightforward websites.

### 2. **Flexibility in Templating**

Eleventy supports multiple templating languages out of the box, including Nunjucks, Liquid, Markdown, and more. This flexibility allows me to select the most suitable tool for each task. For instance, I can write content in Markdown while using Nunjucks for layouts and partials. In contrast, Next.js is tightly coupled with React, which can feel restrictive for simpler projects.

### 3. **No Client-Side JavaScript by Default**

One of Eleventy’s standout features is its ability to generate pure HTML files by default. This means there is no unnecessary client-side JavaScript unless explicitly added. This approach results in faster load times and improved performance, particularly for content-heavy websites. With Next.js, even static pages often include a JavaScript runtime, which can add overhead.

### 4. **Performance**

Eleventy is designed to create blazing-fast websites. Since it generates static HTML files, there is no server-side rendering or hydration overhead. While Next.js also supports static site generation (SSG), its reliance on React can introduce performance bottlenecks for smaller projects.

### 5. **Ease of Deployment**

Deploying an Eleventy site is as simple as uploading static files to a web server or a CDN. There is no need for a Node.js server or additional configuration. This makes it an ideal choice for hosting platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. While Next.js can also be deployed statically, its default setup often requires more configuration.

### 6. **Focus on Content**

Eleventy allows me to focus on what matters most: the content. It does not distract me with complex configurations or framework-specific conventions. For a personal blog or portfolio, this simplicity is invaluable. Next.js, while powerful, often feels like overkill for such use cases.

### 7. **Community and Ecosystem**

Eleventy has a growing and passionate community that values simplicity and performance. The ecosystem is filled with plugins and tools that enhance the development experience without adding unnecessary complexity. While Next.js has a larger community, it is often geared toward more complex, enterprise-level applications.

### 8. **Learning Curve**

Eleventy has a much gentler learning curve compared to Next.js. Since it does not require knowledge of React or advanced JavaScript concepts, it is easier to get started. This makes it a great choice for developers who want to focus on building websites rather than learning a new framework.

### Conclusion

Both Eleventy and Next.js are fantastic tools, but they serve different purposes. If you are building a highly interactive web application, Next.js might be the better choice. However, for static websites, blogs, or portfolios, Eleventy’s simplicity, performance, and flexibility make it a clear winner.

For me, Eleventy strikes the perfect balance between power and simplicity. It allows me to create fast, beautiful websites without the overhead of a full-fledged framework. If you are looking for a tool that gets out of your way and lets you focus on your content, I highly recommend giving Eleventy a try!
